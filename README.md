DOWNLOAD HERE: https://github.com/smphrai/health-monitor-3/blob/main/RELEASED/app-release.apk?raw=true
A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## REPORT 

1. This application can record when and what to drink or take by the elder
2. The category section provides what category of medicine they will take or what they will do
3. The heart pulse will calculate what is the pulse of a person based from photosensors 
```
List<SensorValue> _values;
    double _avg;
    int _n;
    double _m;
    double _threshold;
    double _bpm;
    int _counter;
    int _previous;
    while (_toggled) {
      _values = List.from(_data); // create a copy of the current data array
      _avg = 0;
      _n = _values.length;
      _m = 0;
      _values.forEach((SensorValue value) {
        _avg += value.value / _n;
        if (value.value > _m) _m = value.value;
      });
      _threshold = (_m + _avg) / 2;
      _bpm = 0;
      _counter = 0;
      _previous = 0;
      for (int i = 1; i < _n; i++) {
        if (_values[i - 1].value < _threshold &&
            _values[i].value > _threshold) {
          if (_previous != 0) {
            _counter++;
            _bpm += 60 *
                1000 /
                (_values[i].time.millisecondsSinceEpoch - _previous);
          }
          _previous = _values[i].time.millisecondsSinceEpoch;
        }
      }
      if (_counter > 0) {
        _bpm = _bpm / _counter;
        print(_bpm);
        setState(() {
          this._bpm = ((1 - _alpha) * this._bpm + _alpha * _bpm).toInt();
        });
      }
      await Future.delayed(Duration(
          milliseconds:
              1000 * _windowLen ~/ _fs));

4. health info will show the basic info by the patient
